# GhostRoads-Analysis

Here I examined how the predicted abundance of hunted mammals in Southeast Asian tropical forests are affected by road networks using regional camera trapping (CT) data from six key landscapes recognized as either forest reserve (FR) or national park (NP) (Leuser NP-Indonesia; Khao Chong NP, Khao Yai NP, and Ulu Muda FR-Thailand; Lambir hills NP and Pasoh FR-Malaysia) in the region paired with three different roads metrics. Based off past research that has used the distance to roads as proxies for hunters entering forests and poaching wildlife (e.g., Petersen et al. (2020), Radovani et al. (2015)) and due to the strong wildlife trade throughout the region, we predicted that the abundance of wildlife species will be significantly lower closer to the road infrastructures or has a higher density of roads. However, due to the pervasiveness and severity of ‘ghost roads’ we predict that the abundance of wildlife will be considerably lower closer to ‘ghost roads’ compared to other well-documented infrastructure metrics (Open Street Map-OSM and Global Roads Inventory Project-GRIP).

The CT data has been generated, processed, and sorted by the Ecological Cascades Lab (ECL) and collated from over 20 standardized systematic CT surveys from six forest landscapes in the Southeast Asian region. At each landscape, passive infrared CTs (22-112) were deployed across areas of 48-830 km2, and captures were considered independent if it occurred 30 minutes apart. To allow robust comparisons across landscapes and minimize the effect of different sized areas sampled during CT surveys, all high-resolution CT data has been spatially resampled into grids of equal size and aggregated by their date (Linkie 2020). Moreover, spatially resampling the CT sites satisfies the spatial population closure assumption in hierarchical abundance model, and the CT deployment period (60-90 days) satisfies the temporal population closure assumption (Royle 2004).

The approach will be divided into two steps. Firstly, I collected ghost roads data in six camera trap sites using two different methods: manual digitation from the Google Earth imageries. Secondly, the potential effect of these three road datasets on the relative mammals abundance will be conducted using the N-mixture models (Royle 2004). N-mixture models are hierarchical models, accounting for imperfect detections, that describe the heterogeneity in abundance as a function of environmental covariates measured at every camera trap location, such as roads density (Royle 2004; Kéry & Royle 2015). These covariate values were extracted around the centroid of each CT sites using zonal statistics in ArcGIS, and when multiple CTs occurred in a single resampled grid cell the values were averaged. To account for the large number of zero detections in the data, I pool the data into 5-day sampling intervals and use the ZIP (zero-inflated Poisson distributions) in our N-mixture models (Wenger & Freeman 2008; Joseph et al. 2009; Brodie & Pangau-Adam 2017). For each species assessed (hunted mammals), N-mixture models will be implemented to test each variable individually and then utilize AIC model selection to see which road measure produces the best model fit. Furthermore, we will include all three measures in a single model to examine each measure's relative effect size and significance difference. The followings are an example of N-mixture models applied.

Where GRIP, OSM, and GHOST are the variables name for the global roads inventory project, open-street map, and the ghost roads abbreviation; and 1000 is the buffer 1km from the camera trap points.
